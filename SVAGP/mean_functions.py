    The base mean function class.
    To implement a mean function, write the __call__ method. This takes a
    tensor X and returns a tensor m(X). In accordance with the GPflow
    standard, each row of X represents one datum, and each row of Y is computed
    independently for each row of X.

    MeanFunction classes can have parameters, see the Linear class for an
    example.
